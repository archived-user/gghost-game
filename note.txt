#  Gcloud App Deploy Skipped Files
#
#  The gae-test-skip-files.py is a helpful script to list
#  the files that will be skipped based on the instructions in
#  app.yaml, without actually deploying the code into gcloud.
#  Check the code for instructions to run.
#  (you may need to install pyyaml)


#  Interactive Console
#
#  Testing the app on gcloud dev_appserver.py allows you to run code
#  on the same environment as your app through the Interactive Console.
#  The code below is specific to the gghost app:
#  it creates new Player objects and write all the changes into
#  the development instance's datastore.

from google.appengine.ext import ndb

class Player(ndb.Model):
    # instance id = username
    major = ndb.StringProperty()
    minor = ndb.StringProperty()
    role = ndb.StringProperty(default="major")
    diff = ndb.IntegerProperty(default=9)
    
class Game(ndb.Model):
    # instance id = gid
    player1 = ndb.StringProperty(default=None)
    players = ndb.StringProperty(repeated=True)
    started = ndb.BooleanProperty(default=False)

game = Game.get_by_id("abcd")
newpeeps = ("2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th","8th","9th","1010")
if game:
    game.players.extend(newpeeps)
    game.put()
    for username in newpeeps:
        player = Player(id=username, major="Maj-" + username, minor="Min-"+username)
        player.put()
    print "Added new players!
    print "Current players list", game.players
